This repository is just a way to share some methodology on technologies I use.

As for now it only contains one tutorial (in a jupyter notebook), I might add new topics on the way.

## elasticsearch_data_insertion.ipynb

This is a brief tutorial on data processing with pandas and Elasticsearch.

The goal is to process the data using pandas, and insert it into an Elasticsearch index, to display and manipulate those data in Kibana.
